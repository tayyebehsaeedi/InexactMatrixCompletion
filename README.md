# InexactMatrixCompletion
This is the main code of the following paper:

Tayyebeh Saeedi and Mansoor Rezghi. 
A Novel Enriched Version of Truncated Nuclear Norm Regularization for Matrix Completion of Inexact Observed Data.
Also, The data and the parameters of the methods for these data exist.
For Running the code it is enough to run TNNR-ID (Matlab code) for mentioned TNNR-ID method in the paper and run TNNR-IDD (Matlab code) for mentioned TNNR-IDD method in the paper.

1- Parameters_Method(Block_ID,...): required parameters in Algorithm 1.

2- TNNR-ID (folder): include functions for two steps of the TNNR-ID method.

3- TNNR-IDD (folder): include functions for two steps of the TNNR-IDD method.

4- TNNR-ID (Matlab code): demo file for running the TNNR-ID method.

5- TNNR-IDD (Matlab code): demo file for running the TNNR-IDD method.

6- GaussianPic(folder): noisy data contains Gaussian noise.

7- OMEGA_9: Block missing pattern.

8- Text_noise: Text missing pattern.
