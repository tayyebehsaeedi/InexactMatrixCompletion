# InexactMatrixCompletion This is the main code of the following paper:

Tayyebeh Saeedi and Mansoor Rezghi. 
A Novel Enriched Version of Truncated Nuclear Norm Regularization for Matrix Completion of Inexact Observed Data.
Also, The data and the parameters of the methods for these data are exist.
For Running the code it is enough run TNNR-ID (matlab code) for mentioned TNNR-ID method in paper and run TNNR-IDD (matlab code) for mentioned TNNR-IDD method in paper.
1- Parameters_Method(Block_ID,...): required parameters in Algorithm 1.
2-TNNR-ID (folder): include functions for two steps of TNNR-ID method.
3- TNNR-IDD (folder): include functions for two steps of TNNR-IDD method.
4-TNNR-ID (matlab code): demo file for run TNNR-ID method.
5-TNNR-IDD (matlab code): demo file for run TNNR-IDD method.
6-GaussianPic(folder): noisty data by containes guassian noise.
7- OMEGA_9: Block missing pattern.
8-Text_noise: Text missing pattern.
